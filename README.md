# Kai Stewart - Full Length Resum√©

Computational biologist driven by a fascination with how code can create solutions that compound on each
other to transform biological problems into engineering problems. My work focuses on the development of
streamlined bioinformatics pipelines, building optimization software, and single-cell data analysis. I prioritize best practices like Git and containerization to produce maintainable code and reproducible analyses.
