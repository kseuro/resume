# Kai Stewart - Full Length Resum√©

Curious and motivated computational biologist with experience analyzing genomic and transcriptomic data. I
enjoy the challenge of integrating multi-modal data, including single-cell, bulk RNA, and genomic data, to help
drive questions and insights into mechanisms of disease drug resistance and relapse. I thrive in collaborative
research environments that include scientists of diverse disciplines, and am fascinated by the possibilities that
exist at the interface of computing and life sciences.
