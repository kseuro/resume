## Summary

Computational biologist with 5+ years experience analyzing single‑cell data, building custom bioinformatics and optimization software, and developing data pipelines. Driven by a fascination with how code can transform biological questions into engineering problems — excited to tackle complex problems that can have an outsized impact on human health.

Currently as a scientist on the Computational Biology team at BioNTech, I interface with cross-functional teams and support clinical trials through regular processing of single-cell data and the development of custom bioinformatics software and pipelines. Prior to this, I worked at the Broad Institute as an associate computational biologist where I analyzed cancer genomics data to discover mechanisms of disease drug resistance and relapse.
